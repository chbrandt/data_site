# GMAP data submission

This repository host the code for the data-submission website.
It provides an interface form-based to check and submit a set of data packages 
and the necessary metadata to compose a GMAP data package.

Is is built with Python Flask, and provides a form based on a Meta JSON file.
The backend being Python eases the integration between frontend and the backend
tools we already have built.


# TODO

- [ ] Make a frontpage (index) with a minimal form (eg, "{ name: <> }")
